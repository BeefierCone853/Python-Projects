# **U.S. States Game**

Game where a user enters names of U.S. states. If a user enters a correct name, the name is printed on the image
where the state is located on the map. Also, the game can be quit using the **"exit/Exit"** keyword and the states that
were not guesseed will be **exported** into a *.csv* file.

### Used imports:

#### Turtle - used for GUI
