# *Book Library*

Web pages created using *Flask* and *SQLAlchemy* modules for storing books a person has read.
Books can be added by the user and they will be stored into the **books.db** file.
SQLite is used for storing information about these books (id, title, author and rating).
After adding a book, the rating of a book can still be altered later. Books can also be deleted from the database.

### *Flask* - backend
### *SQLite* - database
