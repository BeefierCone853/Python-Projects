# *Project repository*

This repository is used for **intermediate and harder** projects that can be found on 100 Days of Code.
It was made to share and document my journey learning Python, and also an easy way for myself and others to revisit different projects.

Feel free to reach out and ask me any questions :)

All rights go to the 100 Days of Code instructor Angela Yu.
