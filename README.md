# *Personal Blog*

The webpage is created using *Flask*. All of the modules that are needed for this project to work are listed in the
**requirements.txt** file.  All of the HTML files are stored in the templates folder. 
CSS and various other files i.e. images are stored in the static folder.
If the program is ran locally, users and blog data (content, comments etc.) are stored into a database **blog.db**.
The webpage is also hosted on "https://personal-blog-erik.herokuapp.com/" and uses **Heroku Postgres** database.
Forms are created using the *forms* module.

By being the first person to register you can create posts. Since this is a personal blog, every person who registers
after that can only comment on posts.

### *Flask* - backend
### *Bootstrap* - positioning and styling
### *SQLAlchemy* - local database
### *Heroku Postgres* - hosted database
