# *Data Entry Automation*

From a home and real estate selling webpage, using the *BeatifulSoup* module, the program scrapes the following data for each real estate :
- price
- address
- URL for home details

After scraping, the data is formatted and using the *Selenium* module **automatically** entered into a Google Form,
which can then be viewed in Google Sheets.
