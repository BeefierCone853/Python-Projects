# *Cookie Game with Selenium*

Cheat for the cookie game. Web elements are scraped using *Selenium*. After scraping the needed elements, the program 
automatically clicks the cookie. Every 5 seconds, it checks for the **most expensive** upgrade, buys it and prints the
price on the console. After doing this for 5 minutes, the program stops, scrapes the **cookie per second** element and
prints it on the console.
